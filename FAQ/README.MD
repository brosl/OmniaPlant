# Frequently Asked Questions

### Access
**Q:** How do I get access to the Omnia Timeseries API?<br>
**A:** Take a look at https://github.com/equinor/OmniaPlant/wiki/Authentication-&-Authorization

**Q:** Do I need an Equinor account to use the API?<br>
**A:** To authenticate towards the API with user impersonation, i.e. a software authenticates on behalf you as a person, you need an Equinor account. For service-to-service (m2m) you don't need any Equinor account. You only need access to Internet and provide the client credentials (client id and client secret) that we provides you.
